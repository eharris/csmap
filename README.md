# csmap
Clone of SVN http://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/csmap to make sure a copy survives in case something happens to the OSGeo SVN repo, and also to allow others to use and clone easier than the conversion from SVN was.

This repo is a core component of Norm Olsen's (of Mentor Software Inc.) application Tralaine, which was a very useful tool to convert Geographic coordinate systems in a variety of file types.

Attributions were added as best I could manage based on the info available from the code and the OSGeo site, but several authors are only attributed by name.
